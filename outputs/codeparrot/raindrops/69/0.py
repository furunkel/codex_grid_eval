def raindrops(num):
    """
    Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors.
    A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder.
    The simplest way to test if one number is a factor of another is to use the modulo operation.

    The rules of raindrops are that if a given number:

    has 3 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
    has 5 as a factor, add 'Buzz' to the result.
    has 11 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.
    does not have any of 3, 5, or 11 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number as a string.

    Examples:
    22 has 11 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be "Plong".
    15 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 11, so the result would be "PlangBuzz".
    2 is not factored by 3, 5, or 11, so the result would be "2".

    elif num == 5:
        return "2"
    else:
        return "Plang"
