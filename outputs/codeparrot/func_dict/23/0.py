def generate_dict(n):
    """
    With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, sqrt(i)) such that
    i is a integral number between 1 and n (both included) and then the program should return the dictionary.
    
    Suppose the following input is supplied to the function:
    100
    Then, the output should be:
