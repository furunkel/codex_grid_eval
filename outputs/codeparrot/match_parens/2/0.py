    You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open
    brackets '[' or close brackets ']' only.
    Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in
    some order, that the resulting string will be good.
    A string S is considered to be good if and only if all brackets in S
    are balanced. For example: the string '[[]][]' is good, while the string
    '[]]' is not.
    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

    Examples:
    match_parens(['[][', ']']) == 'Yes'
    match_parens([']', ']']) == 'No'
