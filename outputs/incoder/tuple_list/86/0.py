Exercise 3
Write a function that takes a list and returns a new list with all the elements of the list that have even second values, and all the elements of the list that have odd second values.

For example, given [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)], return [(1, 2), (5, 6)].

Hint: You can use the second value of the tuple in the if statement.

Write a function that takes a list and returns a new list with all the elements of the list that have even second values, and all the elements of the list that have odd second values, but only if the second value of the tuple is greater than 0.
