Tuples
A tuple is an (immutable) ordered list of values. A tuple is in many ways similar to a list, but is resizeable and can contain different types of objects. Tuples are written with parentheses instead of square brackets.

The syntax for tuples is as follows:

(<value1>, <value2>, <value3>, ...)
