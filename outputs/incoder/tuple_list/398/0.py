The `sorted` function will sort the list in-place, so you don't need to return a new list. Also, you don't need to call `sorted` twice; you can just do `lst[-1][-1]`.

Thanks, I didn't know that. I've updated the answer accordingly.

Thanks for your answer! I didn't know that you can do `lst[-1][-1]` like that. I'm still new to python and I didn't know that you can do that. Thanks again!
