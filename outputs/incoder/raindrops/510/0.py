def raindrops(num):
    """
    Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors.
    A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder.
    The simplest way to test if one number is a factor of another is to use the modulo operation.

    The rules of raindrops are that if a given number:

    has 13 as a factor, add 'Fizz' to the result.
    has 5 as a factor, add 'Buzz' to the result.
    has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.
    does not have any of 13, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number as a string.

    Examples:
    14 has 7 as a factor, but not 13 or 5, so the result would be "Plong".
    65 has both 13 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be "FizzBuzz".
    2 is not factored by 13, 5, or 7, so the result would be "2".
    """
    
    if num % 13 == 0:
        return "Fizz"
    elif num % 5 == 0:
        return "Buzz"
    elif num % 7 == 0:
        return "Plong"
    else:
        return str(num)

Question 3
Write a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of the numbers in the list. Make sure to convert your list to a string before you do this.

Examples:
[1,2,3] => 6
[1,2,3,4,5] => 15
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] => 55
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55] => 55
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100] => 100
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100] => 100
