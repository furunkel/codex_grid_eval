    """
    Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors.
    A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder.
    The simplest way to test if one number is a factor of another is to use the modulo operation.

    The rules of raindrops are that if a given number:

    has 11 as a factor, add 'Fizz' to the result.
    has 3 as a factor, add 'Buzz' to the result.
    has 5 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.
    does not have any of 11, 3, or 5 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number as a string.

    Examples:
    10 has 5 as a factor, but not 11 or 3, so the result would be "Plong".
    33 has both 11 and 3 as factors, but not 5, so the result would be "FizzBuzz".
    2 is not factored by 11, 3, or 5, so the result would be "2".
