Problem 8
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

Problem 9
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Hint: consider the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million.

To get the sum of the even-valued terms, you need to sum the numbers on the left of the middle five prime numbers.
