Problem 8
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the sum of the first six prime numbers is 23.

What is the sum of the numbers on the left of the colon in this expression below?

a) $1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13$

b) $1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 11 + 13$

c) $1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13$
