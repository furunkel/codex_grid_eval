Problem 10
Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

Problem 11
Let us list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, but not 9, because 9 can be divided by 3 but not 5.

73, 79, and 81 are amicable numbers.
Find the sum of all the amicable numbers
