    With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i * i) such that
    i is a integral number between 1 and n (both included) and then the program should return the dictionary.
    
    Suppose the following input is supplied to the function:
    8
    Then, the output should be:
    {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}
