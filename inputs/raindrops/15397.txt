def raindrops(num):
    """
    Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors.
    A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder.
    The simplest way to test if one number is a factor of another is to use the modulo operation.

    The rules of raindrops are that if a given number:

    has 7 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
    has 13 as a factor, add 'Fuzz' to the result.
    has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.
    does not have any of 7, 13, or 3 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number as a string.

    Examples:
    3 has 3 as a factor, but not 7 or 13, so the result would be "Pling".
    91 has both 7 and 13 as factors, but not 3, so the result would be "PlangFuzz".
    1 is not factored by 7, 13, or 3, so the result would be "1".
