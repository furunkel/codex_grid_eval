"""
With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i - i) such that i is a integral number between 1 and n (both included) and then the program should print the dictionary.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
5
Then, the output should be:
{1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0}

Hint:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
