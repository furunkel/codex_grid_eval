With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i * i) such that i is a integral number between 1 and n (both included) and then the program should print the dictionary.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
3
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}
