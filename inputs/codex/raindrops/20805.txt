def raindrops(num):
    """
    Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors.
    A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder.
    The simplest way to test if one number is a factor of another is to use the modulo operation.

    The rules of raindrops are that if a given number:

    has 11 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
    has 13 as a factor, add 'Buzz' to the result.
    has 3 as a factor, add 'Fizz' to the result.
    does not have any of 11, 13, or 3 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number as a string.

    Examples:
    3 has 3 as a factor, but not 11 or 13, so the result would be "Fizz".
    143 has both 11 and 13 as factors, but not 3, so the result would be "PlangBuzz".
    1 is not factored by 11, 13, or 3, so the result would be "1".
